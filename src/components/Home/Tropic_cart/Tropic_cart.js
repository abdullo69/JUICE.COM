                        <h1>Tropical Plants + Herbs</h1>
                        <p>Our nuanced blends feature tropical fruits and veggies, packed with more vitamins, more antioxidants, and more fiber than the other leading brands. And, transparency is our love language â€“ no added nasty preservatives, clean, easy to read labels, and plant-based PET bottles. Becauseâ€¦we love the planet just as much as we love you ðŸ’š</p>

                        <h1>Functional Ingredients</h1>
                        <p>We donâ€™t stop at nutrient-rich fruits and veggies becauseâ€¦we care about your health just as much as you do! Finding juices that provide a multitude of nutrients can be hard to find. We infuse functional ingredients like turmeric, maca root, ashwaghanda, ginger, and camu camu to give your body the extra boost it needs.</p>

                        <p>We may be hard at work blending and bottling, but if it wasnâ€™t for our dedicated farmers, we wouldnâ€™t be able to provide you with the highest quality juices. From vine to bottle, they ensure each crop is picked at peak freshness to deliver the most nutritious fruits and vegetables.</p>
